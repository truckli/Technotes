\subsection{L2TP}
VPN is implemented by L2TP or PPTP, the former of which is more secure.

L2TP is the payload of UDP. L2TP is usually used to transport PPP sessions.
L2TP uses IPSec to support anthentication and encryption.


Some L2TP servers require no shared key. In that case, a client should create a
configuration file /etc/ppp/options:
\begin{verbatim}
plugin L2TP.ppp
l2tpnoipsec
\end{verbatim}
